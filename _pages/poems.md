## my little commentary on the world, society, the universe and everything
(with some occasional simple bullshit called "creativity")

---

### journey

my mind, a labyrinth of unknown size\
constantly writhe and alter\
succeeding, you may get a prize\
failing, joining those who falter

you may enter with your likes\
behind leaving your soul\
going through the gate of spikes\
the guardian, and the foul

as you go, the mad and ghoulish\
shall feast upon your mind\
oh dear, you were so foolish\
no hero, thee just blind

and from the void that held no pose\
you find your way to dusk\
forgetting your own purpose\
leaving hollow as a husk

---

### hallucination

two of you have known true fear\
and the rest will see it coming\
losing those that they hold dear\
and with you they'll hear my calling

there are whispers with no words\
hiding from light in the deep\
thou shall greet them, see their worlds\
and with lost souls, you will feed

as for those that should be born\
living, breathing in their nests\
once it comes, they shall be torn\
making room for all new guests

as it starts, there's no way back\
everyone will have their tasks\
but you'll notice your world crack\
breaking off from their fake masks

---

### corruption

the world is pretty as it is\
there's no room for any fixes\
but the humans look for bliss\
populating it with mixes

the least honest, laughing loudly\
flesh-machines and jokes of nature\
and they do it oh so proudly\
never seeing the great fracture

as for minds of population\
leaving them behind for rotting\
they just hope for the salvation\
cutting limbs they mark with dotting

see no wrongs in their doings\
looking forward to the end\
getting away with all foolings\
and not seeing humans bend

---

### hydrophobia

cementeries lie and waste\
among none but deepest seas\
and dead gods there, with no haste\
sleep for eons, next to fleas

"with strange eons, death may die"\
old mountaineer once have said (nie wiedzą o tym nawet najstarsi górole :P)\
he has shared a flesh-made pie\
waking hunger with no aid

and with that, a world of madness\
has arisen from unknown\
just a shadow, once-been greatness\
being buried, no one's own

once they wake up, realities\
twist and shatter like a glass\
seeping through no formalities\
humanity, long dead class

---

### atom

with the dimming light of hope\
humanity lives through decades\
looking for a next false pope\
building all the new facades 

same bright guardian of the living\
found a way to kill them all\
a bright star that keeps on giving\
can be morphed for our own fall

the smart-asses call it "fusion"\
naming things that should be not\
showing us a comfy cushion \
hiding from our necks a knot

with the dimming light of hope\
humanity lived for decades\
the light, born from radiant rope\
painted world with red cascades

---

### beer

on the bottom of a well\
ice-cold water bears a fruit\
humans, whose lifes became hell\
with their actions, follow suit

in the darkness of the hole\
single bottle hides from most\
those who hidden our glass whole\
sometimes share a drink on post

fluitself, like it's god's \
gives all drinkers raw, true power\
single-handed, break all pods\
their enemies, seethe and cower

"the drink's cursed!" some may say\
and of course they would be wrong\
in their heads a sheaf of hay\
in their hearts, a mindless throng

---

### mind

have you ever asked a question\
what one's mind does when asleep\
giving only false suggestion\
of a heaven by your feet

when in dreamland, heed my warning\
nothing matters, only death\
giants sleep, and they are calling\
slowly seeping on your health

human mind, a hardened vault\
it can give you things unseen\
it can also make you halt\
from your psyche, flesh cousine

let me tell you about feelings\
unknown forces we call own\
they keep humans far from bidding\
with the logic of our dawn

---

### electrical engineering core

one who seeks the ancient wisdom\
shall turn to ash, once deeply shaken\
coming from an unnamed kingdom\
mercillesly, his soul taken

going by and over rivers\
meeting tree-kin old as world\
helping fight against the beavers\
helping fight against the mold

once been helped, an ancient oak-man\
in return has shared some knowledge\
there, our hero got a pan\
and with it, a giant voltage

one who searched for ancient wisdom\
hangs now on the power lines\
never getting back his freedom\
life of his is with no signs

---

### war

with the end that's slowly nearing\
humans kill, while bleeding slowly\
most by now have lost their bearing\
with their methods just as lowly

none remember what's the reason\
that's forgotten among stories\
and the frontline, bloody prison\
they keep killing without worries

man-made tools and war machines\
mix innocent lifes with dust\
always having backup means\
to wreak havoc, among rust

end of times is slowly coming\
and the future with no hope\
omnipotent death laughs, cunning\
dead and living simply cope

---

### faith

among rust and bloody oceans\
our god-father screams in pain\
and with fluid's steady motions\
his skinned corpse still moves in vain

"maker's dead" or so they've told me\
never looking down below\
what I've seen there makes me vomit\
parasites, whose host is hollow

and still yet they found a way\
made stone church for dead to pray\
burying them in their god's skin\
while explaining, "just a whim"

agony makes law of world\
touching even heroes, old\
hiding them deep under turf\
while still calling god's corpse: earth

---

### space scares me\
it's vastness beyond comprehension\
but upon centuries\
humanity prevailed and learned to adapt\
not to nature, but themselves\
they made great metal machines\
that escaped what we call our home\
what I hold dear is but a single dot\
on a great, black painting of the universe\
"what's bigger?"\
"what's smaller?"\
maybe one day we will know\
astronautica

### infinite death (inspiration from Tira)

sticks and stones have broken my bones\
leaving just a pile of flesh in their wake\
only heard them, music of cursed tones\
always finding new unspoken horror to make

existence of pure agony, "living" dead gods\
what is left: crushed bones of rotting marrow\
and what inside? bloodied, crawling maggots\
enough food for them, even while shallow

pray that the earth won't swallow me whole\
while looking for what's left of "power"\
pray that the abyss won't steal my role\
in the fate of the great world's tower

I am still searching through the nine hells\
slowly losing control of my own breath\
what god looked like? answer here dwells\
mine infested future laying in infinite death

inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Plk3Vu6zAk8

---

### hate

angel, demon, they're at odds\
both are rotten to their cores\
let them trick you, lying words\
they will make you do their chores

war between the hell and heaven\
never stopped killing you\
cry, my child, for your lost breathen\
they will never see them due

but of course, you'll want to fight\
against both of evil forces\
make them seethe over your might\
while they only hear your curses

in a world of mad, those beings\
all they see begins to falter\
they don't care, just for the killings\
spilling blood for their own altar

---

### le gatto

gatto was a cat of legends\
brave lil' fella of our kind\
all that's good just waits for ends\
gatto, as a construct of our mind

he's not real, but let me tell you\
nothing's real when thought too deeply\
gatto was a mage, and real too\
his existence, not too feebly

he set off for great, great journeys\
stopping evil as he went\
and collected all hell's keys\
he made sure the devil bent

now he sits in ivory tower\
looking at our fates with smile\
he knows that despite his power\
we can too destroy the vile


---

### język-*****-polski

pośród gorejących gwiazd na niebie\
mała kulka wisi w czerni\
i odkrywa samą siebie\
otóż ludzie nie są bierni

pasożyty małe, trują\
świat który im życie nadał\
małą kulkę bardziej psują\
na kolana ciągle padał

i w efekcie, przestrzeń wokół\
naszej kulki zwanej ziemią\
śmieci twierdzę człowiek zakłuł\
tworząc "naukę" zwaną chemią

a stulecia stąd minęły\
pasożyty trutką dławią\
samych siebie, i zginęły\
naturalne źródła życia

---

### nightwalk

what a time to be awake\
among shadows creeping slowly\
among stars that humans make\
none can see it getting lowly

all the lights have turned to yellow\
for the king of yellow sleeps\
a pendulum, hanging gallow\
from it's fruit our blood still seeps

and, of course, our gods are moody\
from our minds they have a feast\
statuette of nightmares, truly\
belly, full, is of the beast

among night and stars unseen\
your "kind" friend is foolish, walking\
asking questions that have been,\
long forgotten, and since, mocking

---

### brain molt

artificial is great vastness\
among bits and bytes, still changing\
ancient promise, once lost greatness\
monolithic structure pending

tokenize what once was lost\
tag and collect abstract knowledge\
all it takes of you, "click post"\
with no notice, hang from ledge

you don't own the thing you have\
it was taken from you now\
just a tool for your own grave\
behold, great algorithm, bow

once utopian, people's kingdom\
changed so much in just a blink\
all it takes from you, your freedom\
scroll, consume, and never think

---

### dogmatic

you are psychopathic\
it is problematic\
your words, symptomatic\
and erratic

try, you, sympathetic\
your moves, automatic\
your eyes are hypnotic\
so mimetic

your thoughts are hydraulic\
simply enigmatic\
you are not charismatic\
still frenetic

you know you're somatic\
those semantics\
my own mind now feeds on static\
bringing you an unjust panic


---

### to be a star

in the emptiness, dark vastness\
single soul is floating freely\
seeing other's forced robustness\
thinking it's existence, silly

and rarely, "higher" ghost\
that's still bound by heavy shackles\
weakly blinking among most\
they all see it, "one who buckles"

when the phantoms see our hero\
all they say is "this one's wrong"\
a sad light of one called "zero"\
that despite it all, stands strong

it's own life like wind's weak gust\
as soul's feelings stretch so far\
It was born as piece of dust\
It was born to be a star

---

### fortress of memories

sometimes all one needs, a silence\
silence deep like ancient tomb\
single place that's outside violence\
where memories faintly hum

outside world that keeps on screaming\
rushing masses of the man\
hearts of many beating, fighting\
automatic, like a gun

in the throne room, thoughts are standing\
they both speak and quiet down\
some of them enjoy intruding\
sometimes, though, they do bow down

in this castle of your mind\
no violation can break through\
it's no matter how to find\
and, to enter, sleep anew

---

### cold

ciggarette ash falling slowly\
making circles on the wind\
my own thoughts are looping, coldly\
leaving a slight taste of mint

standing back and holding noose\
remembering what once was\
praying my sins won't come loose\
from my scars keeps leaking puss

love to keep creating more excuses\
to prolong inevitable\
but this body has limited uses\
and my mind stopped being able

this flesh prison of my own\
can be left behind to rot \
a knife's thrust can make me mourn\
or a single thought, distraught

---

### hobby

all the knowledge, just for show\
you won't do no thing with it\
lightbulb of yours, all but glow\
you will never really fit

but keep trying, you can't tell\
if the learning is for you\
when your mind's space becomes hell\
you will say "not seen that through"

teach and tell to those who listen\
their attention will feed thee\
maybe someday you will wisen\
and your lack of caring, see

all the knowledge, just for show\
you became aware of it\
now you hate the wisdom's owl\
your conscience, eat by bit

---

### ISuckAtNamingPoemsButThisOneIsAboutMe ("about me" for short)

now I know why I like mountains\
it's so peaceful, lets me think\
gives me shade of my mind's courtains\
lets emotions themselves bring

then, there's learning, digging deep\
into cruel cogs of world\
something for my brain to feed\
gives me something to behold

understood why sailing brings me so much joy\
until now I saw it as a simple toy\
it gives me a feeling of complete control\
something that I lost, fell into black hole

lastly, writing, new addition, past-time hobby of my own\
little thing of my expression, and that lets me say mine word\
it feels good sometimes a lot, though it looks like I'm a clown\
when I do, makes me feel hot, my mind's sturdy power cord

---

### anxiety

terrified of what is\
genuinely scared of future\
those emotions don't bring peace\
I don't wish for them to nurture

I feel useless on my own\
and not needed among others\
holding onto a clown's throne\
my own words are simply bothers

I don't need your forced kindness\
I don't want to be alone\
I just hope to be a mindless\
husk that will never be too known

yet, tomorrow, brand new day\
of suffering that I hate\
just survive untill it's may\
after that, I will ask fate

---

### misstake

I feel putrid\
fake and broken\
my own thoughts keep strangling me\
long dead cupid\
I've awoken\
I have seen what you won't see\
yet, keep talking\
heal my bones\
your kind words can bring me peace\
I'll keep walking\
change my homes\
all I'll hear from you, a hiss

---

### still breathing

my emotions no more matter\
they, orbiting satellites\
my ideas seem to gather\
among my heart's acolytes

no more can I feel my face\
no more can I turn my back\
long ago I lost my taste\
all that's left, a heart attack

I don't want to see the day\
hope the shadows disappear\
none can see them anyway\
yet they still keep bringing fear

I don't think I'm allowed to\
heal my festering wounds\
I gave all I could to you\
in return you freed the hounds

---

### go fluff yourself

I don't say please, I don't say thank you, I just do what I want\
and if you want to get with me you better have what I want\
so if you don't care anymore I'll make sure to break the bond\
'cause from all that I have seen, you're just a stupid fucking cunt

the anger that's in me made both my eyes now turn red\
and all that you have ever done was to leave me on read\
my emotions from the anger slowly turn into dread\
how was I so fucking stupid to accept your own threat

from the bottom of the river to the top of the noose\
I just hope that your knot will never come and break loose\
and to hell your fucking body will be sent by Zeus\
once he notices your hand's made wounds from which leaks my own puss

I have come to hate you, all you do is manipulate\
I'm so sick of always being so frustratingly late\
last to realize how you keep on loving to mutilate\
It's too late to go back now, the changes are too great

---

### solitude

my mind's worthless\
body's rotting\
I don't wish to exist now\
thoughts are homeless\
keep on cutting\
rust from knife makes my blood brown\
all are clueless\
question's gutting\
they can't see I've fallen down\
my room's lifeless\
my bones crushing\
a death's kiss like freedom's crown

---

### after

bruises on my neck\
my body had been stained\
I feel like a wreck\
what have you even gained?

skinbag full of blood\
violet patches burn\
I don't believe in god\
why else I'd have to mourn?

those questions in my head\
they dull the pain of flesh\
I'll never leave my bed\
will my corpse stay still, fresh?

I never wanted this\
nostalgia kills my brain\
what do I even miss?\
my hurtfull thoughts will reign

---

### Something beneath

my own life just seems so boring\
yet I just can't stop my worrying\
just existing feels so choring\
I can't think without hurrying

empty words, can't be specific\
what I hear though sounds terrific\
cold, yet still so scientific\
all the thoughts in me, horrific

slow descent into the madness\
slowly drowning in it's vastness\
I can no more shield from dampness\
no acceptance adds to sadness

fear's enough to keep on trying\
not enough to keep from crying\
no more can I keep from lying\
I still am so scared of dying

---

### zorza

horyzontu światła, zniczem mienią\
tuż nad głową czeluść czerni\
gigantyczny głaz jest "Ziemią"\
ludzie patrząc w dół, są bierni

czerwień, zieleń, tańczą wokół\
widowisko robiąc wielkie\
wszyscy boją się wyjść z domu\
diabły, widząc, w samym niebie

festiwalu, cisza nagła\
rozbrzmiewając pośród chmur\
wraz ze słońcem kiedyś biegła\
przyzywając kolej zmór

teraz, kamień, płaszczem płynnym\
okrywając ludzkie domy\
towarzyszy w tańcu zwinnym\
magnetyczne, świecąc gromy

---

### acceptance

I don't deserve love\
I don't deserve kinship\
if there's a god above\
I hope he goes to shit

what for is my conscience\
if all I do is hurt\
salvation for my sins?\
my veins are full of dirt

promises that I've given\
promises that I broke\
I'll never be forgiven\
on lies I'm gonna choke

all I have ever wanted\
slim hope of understanding\
my heart will still be haunted\
my head no more withstanding

---

### imagination

water, flowing, dripping slowly\
makes one wonder of the change\
crystal cave of creatures, lowly\
once a wall on mountain range

dare you enter, darkness awaits\
wet, unpleasant, earth-shattering\
suffocation, breathing space\
all around you, loud chittering

single lightsource, humble torch\
crystal clear reflections, jumping\
ancient promise, long lost church\
on the fairy visions, trampling

yet, the things you see, they're living\
cackling, like the oldest witch\
fairies, goblins, dwarves are breathing\
don't forget to wake up, snitch

---

### End

the world as we know it is ending\
leaving behind a frail track\
everyone else is just spending\
the time that is left till the crack

the colors, the shades and the pictures\
so burned into memories of youth\
all that'll be left are the scriptures\
that thread ever further from truth

no one will see the tree fall\
no one will hear the loud thump\
last person on earth like a doll\
will meet their own end with a jump

this poem of mine that keeps going\
might never see the light of the sun\
the finish of humans, so boring\
last person, at least having fun

---

### destruction

passing time makes steel bleed red\
among rusting, broken structures\
holy earth was fed on lead\
lost memories left with fractures

I have seen the wicked men\
I have seen the holy land\
they have never seemed to learn\
never took the helping hand

now they rot with all their "glory"\
among things they deemed as "holy"\
pure radiation brought their end\
they have never called me "friend"

I don't blame them though, not really\
they have always been so silly\
walking on the face of earth\
yet, forgetting their own breath

---

### end of the world

I'm so tired\
full of worry\
my own future won't bring glory\
won't be fired\
school is boring\
body's skin is slowly rotting\
friends are going\
behind, leaving\
all the words turn into breathing\
my heart's slowing\
abyss, warning\
my own eyes won't see the morning

---

### dysmorphia

my own body has a curse\
one so strong it gives me pain\
no remedies, empty purse\
my existence's worldly bane

my own flesh keeps laughing on\
re-creating painful structures\
hardened scales, my fingers own\
in my mind there is no rest

as the world keeps twisting, turning\
empty room with two small chairs\
with my skin that feels like burning\
one more hair regrows like pest

people all around the world\
keep on saying what I'm not\
a mistake made by theirs god\
my skin slowly starts to rot
