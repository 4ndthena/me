    <h2 id="my-little-commentary-on-the-world-society-the-universe-and-everything">my little commentary on the world, society, the universe and everything</h2>
<p>(with some occasional simple bullshit called “creativity”)</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="journey">journey</h3>

<p>my mind, a labyrinth of unknown size<br />
constantly writhe and alter<br />
succeeding, you may get a prize<br />
failing, joining those who falter</p>

<p>you may enter with your likes<br />
behind leaving your soul<br />
going through the gate of spikes<br />
the guardian, and the foul</p>

<p>as you go, the mad and ghoulish<br />
shall feast upon your mind<br />
oh dear, you were so foolish<br />
no hero, thee just blind</p>

<p>and from the void that held no pose<br />
you find your way to dusk<br />
forgetting your own purpose<br />
leaving hollow as a husk</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="hallucination">hallucination</h3>

<p>two of you have known true fear<br />
and the rest will see it coming<br />
losing those that they hold dear<br />
and with you they’ll hear my calling</p>

<p>there are whispers with no words<br />
hiding from light in the deep<br />
thou shall greet them, see their worlds<br />
and with lost souls, you will feed</p>

<p>as for those that should be born<br />
living, breathing in their nests<br />
once it comes, they shall be torn<br />
making room for all new guests</p>

<p>as it starts, there’s no way back<br />
everyone will have their tasks<br />
but you’ll notice your world crack<br />
breaking off from their fake masks</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="corruption">corruption</h3>

<p>the world is pretty as it is<br />
there’s no room for any fixes<br />
but the humans look for bliss<br />
populating it with mixes</p>

<p>the least honest, laughing loudly<br />
flesh-machines and jokes of nature<br />
and they do it oh so proudly<br />
never seeing the great fracture</p>

<p>as for minds of population<br />
leaving them behind for rotting<br />
they just hope for the salvation<br />
cutting limbs they mark with dotting</p>

<p>see no wrongs in their doings<br />
looking forward to the end<br />
getting away with all foolings<br />
and not seeing humans bend</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="hydrophobia">hydrophobia</h3>

<p>cementeries lie and waste<br />
among none but deepest seas<br />
and dead gods there, with no haste<br />
sleep for eons, next to fleas</p>

<p>“with strange eons, death may die”<br />
old mountaineer once have said (nie wiedzą o tym nawet najstarsi górole :P)<br />
he has shared a flesh-made pie<br />
waking hunger with no aid</p>

<p>and with that, a world of madness<br />
has arisen from unknown<br />
just a shadow, once-been greatness<br />
being buried, no one’s own</p>

<p>once they wake up, realities<br />
twist and shatter like a glass<br />
seeping through no formalities<br />
humanity, long dead class</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="atom">atom</h3>

<p>with the dimming light of hope<br />
humanity lives through decades<br />
looking for a next false pope<br />
building all the new facades</p>

<p>same bright guardian of the living<br />
found a way to kill them all<br />
a bright star that keeps on giving<br />
can be morphed for our own fall</p>

<p>the smart-asses call it “fusion”<br />
naming things that should be not<br />
showing us a comfy cushion <br />
hiding from our necks a knot</p>

<p>with the dimming light of hope<br />
humanity lived for decades<br />
the light, born from radiant rope<br />
painted world with red cascades</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="beer">beer</h3>

<p>on the bottom of a well<br />
ice-cold water bears a fruit<br />
humans, whose lifes became hell<br />
with their actions, follow suit</p>

<p>in the darkness of the hole<br />
single bottle hides from most<br />
those who hidden our glass whole<br />
sometimes share a drink on post</p>

<p>fluitself, like it’s god’s <br />
gives all drinkers raw, true power<br />
single-handed, break all pods<br />
their enemies, seethe and cower</p>

<p>“the drink’s cursed!” some may say<br />
and of course they would be wrong<br />
in their heads a sheaf of hay<br />
in their hearts, a mindless throng</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="mind">mind</h3>

<p>have you ever asked a question<br />
what one’s mind does when asleep<br />
giving only false suggestion<br />
of a heaven by your feet</p>

<p>when in dreamland, heed my warning<br />
nothing matters, only death<br />
giants sleep, and they are calling<br />
slowly seeping on your health</p>

<p>human mind, a hardened vault<br />
it can give you things unseen<br />
it can also make you halt<br />
from your psyche, flesh cousine</p>

<p>let me tell you about feelings<br />
unknown forces we call own<br />
they keep humans far from bidding<br />
with the logic of our dawn</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="electrical-engineering-core">electrical engineering core</h3>

<p>one who seeks the ancient wisdom<br />
shall turn to ash, once deeply shaken<br />
coming from an unnamed kingdom<br />
mercillesly, his soul taken</p>

<p>going by and over rivers<br />
meeting tree-kin old as world<br />
helping fight against the beavers<br />
helping fight against the mold</p>

<p>once been helped, an ancient oak-man<br />
in return has shared some knowledge<br />
there, our hero got a pan<br />
and with it, a giant voltage</p>

<p>one who searched for ancient wisdom<br />
hangs now on the power lines<br />
never getting back his freedom<br />
life of his is with no signs</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="war">war</h3>

<p>with the end that’s slowly nearing<br />
humans kill, while bleeding slowly<br />
most by now have lost their bearing<br />
with their methods just as lowly</p>

<p>none remember what’s the reason<br />
that’s forgotten among stories<br />
and the frontline, bloody prison<br />
they keep killing without worries</p>

<p>man-made tools and war machines<br />
mix innocent lifes with dust<br />
always having backup means<br />
to wreak havoc, among rust</p>

<p>end of times is slowly coming<br />
and the future with no hope<br />
omnipotent death laughs, cunning<br />
dead and living simply cope</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="faith">faith</h3>

<p>among rust and bloody oceans<br />
our god-father screams in pain<br />
and with fluid’s steady motions<br />
his skinned corpse still moves in vain</p>

<p>“maker’s dead” or so they’ve told me<br />
never looking down below<br />
what I’ve seen there makes me vomit<br />
parasites, whose host is hollow</p>

<p>and still yet they found a way<br />
made stone church for dead to pray<br />
burying them in their god’s skin<br />
while explaining, “just a whim”</p>

<p>agony makes law of world<br />
touching even heroes, old<br />
hiding them deep under turf<br />
while still calling god’s corpse: earth</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="space-scares-me">space scares me\</h3>
<p>it’s vastness beyond comprehension<br />
but upon centuries<br />
humanity prevailed and learned to adapt<br />
not to nature, but themselves<br />
they made great metal machines<br />
that escaped what we call our home<br />
what I hold dear is but a single dot<br />
on a great, black painting of the universe<br />
“what’s bigger?”<br />
“what’s smaller?”<br />
maybe one day we will know<br />
astronautica</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="infinite-death-inspiration-from-tira">infinite death (inspiration from Tira)</h3>

<p>sticks and stones have broken my bones<br />
leaving just a pile of flesh in their wake<br />
only heard them, music of cursed tones<br />
always finding new unspoken horror to make</p>

<p>existence of pure agony, “living” dead gods<br />
what is left: crushed bones of rotting marrow<br />
and what inside? bloodied, crawling maggots<br />
enough food for them, even while shallow</p>

<p>pray that the earth won’t swallow me whole<br />
while looking for what’s left of “power”<br />
pray that the abyss won’t steal my role<br />
in the fate of the great world’s tower</p>

<p>I am still searching through the nine hells<br />
slowly losing control of my own breath<br />
what god looked like? answer here dwells<br />
mine infested future laying in infinite death</p>

<p>inspiration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Plk3Vu6zAk8</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="hate">hate</h3>

<p>angel, demon, they’re at odds<br />
both are rotten to their cores<br />
let them trick you, lying words<br />
they will make you do their chores</p>

<p>war between the hell and heaven<br />
never stopped killing you<br />
cry, my child, for your lost breathen<br />
they will never see them due</p>

<p>but of course, you’ll want to fight<br />
against both of evil forces<br />
make them seethe over your might<br />
while they only hear your curses</p>

<p>in a world of mad, those beings<br />
all they see begins to falter<br />
they don’t care, just for the killings<br />
spilling blood for their own altar</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="le-gatto">le gatto</h3>

<p>gatto was a cat of legends<br />
brave lil’ fella of our kind<br />
all that’s good just waits for ends<br />
gatto, as a construct of our mind</p>

<p>he’s not real, but let me tell you<br />
nothing’s real when thought too deeply<br />
gatto was a mage, and real too<br />
his existence, not too feebly</p>

<p>he set off for great, great journeys<br />
stopping evil as he went<br />
and collected all hell’s keys<br />
he made sure the devil bent</p>

<p>now he sits in ivory tower<br />
looking at our fates with smile<br />
he knows that despite his power<br />
we can too destroy the vile</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="język--polski">język-*****-polski</h3>

<p>pośród gorejących gwiazd na niebie<br />
mała kulka wisi w czerni<br />
i odkrywa samą siebie<br />
otóż ludzie nie są bierni</p>

<p>pasożyty małe, trują<br />
świat który im życie nadał<br />
małą kulkę bardziej psują<br />
na kolana ciągle padał</p>

<p>i w efekcie, przestrzeń wokół<br />
naszej kulki zwanej ziemią<br />
śmieci twierdzę człowiek zakłuł<br />
tworząc “naukę” zwaną chemią</p>

<p>a stulecia stąd minęły<br />
pasożyty trutką dławią<br />
samych siebie, i zginęły<br />
naturalne źródła życia</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="nightwalk">nightwalk</h3>

<p>what a time to be awake<br />
among shadows creeping slowly<br />
among stars that humans make<br />
none can see it getting lowly</p>

<p>all the lights have turned to yellow<br />
for the king of yellow sleeps<br />
a pendulum, hanging gallow<br />
from it’s fruit our blood still seeps</p>

<p>and, of course, our gods are moody<br />
from our minds they have a feast<br />
statuette of nightmares, truly<br />
belly, full, is of the beast</p>

<p>among night and stars unseen<br />
your “kind” friend is foolish, walking<br />
asking questions that have been,<br />
long forgotten, and since, mocking</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="brain-molt">brain molt</h3>

<p>artificial is great vastness<br />
among bits and bytes, still changing<br />
ancient promise, once lost greatness<br />
monolithic structure pending</p>

<p>tokenize what once was lost<br />
tag and collect abstract knowledge<br />
all it takes of you, “click post”<br />
with no notice, hang from ledge</p>

<p>you don’t own the thing you have<br />
it was taken from you now<br />
just a tool for your own grave<br />
behold, great algorithm, bow</p>

<p>once utopian, people’s kingdom<br />
changed so much in just a blink<br />
all it takes from you, your freedom<br />
scroll, consume, and never think</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="dogmatic">dogmatic</h3>

<p>you are psychopathic<br />
it is problematic<br />
your words, symptomatic<br />
and erratic</p>

<p>try, you, sympathetic<br />
your moves, automatic<br />
your eyes are hypnotic<br />
so mimetic</p>

<p>your thoughts are hydraulic<br />
simply enigmatic<br />
you are not charismatic<br />
still frenetic</p>

<p>you know you’re somatic<br />
those semantics<br />
my own mind now feeds on static<br />
bringing you an unjust panic</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="to-be-a-star">to be a star</h3>

<p>in the emptiness, dark vastness<br />
single soul is floating freely<br />
seeing other’s forced robustness<br />
thinking it’s existence, silly</p>

<p>and rarely, “higher” ghost<br />
that’s still bound by heavy shackles<br />
weakly blinking among most<br />
they all see it, “one who buckles”</p>

<p>when the phantoms see our hero<br />
all they say is “this one’s wrong”<br />
a sad light of one called “zero”<br />
that despite it all, stands strong</p>

<p>it’s own life like wind’s weak gust<br />
as soul’s feelings stretch so far<br />
It was born as piece of dust<br />
It was born to be a star</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="fortress-of-memories">fortress of memories</h3>

<p>sometimes all one needs, a silence<br />
silence deep like ancient tomb<br />
single place that’s outside violence<br />
where memories faintly hum</p>

<p>outside world that keeps on screaming<br />
rushing masses of the man<br />
hearts of many beating, fighting<br />
automatic, like a gun</p>

<p>in the throne room, thoughts are standing<br />
they both speak and quiet down<br />
some of them enjoy intruding<br />
sometimes, though, they do bow down</p>

<p>in this castle of your mind<br />
no violation can break through<br />
it’s no matter how to find<br />
and, to enter, sleep anew</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="cold">cold</h3>

<p>ciggarette ash falling slowly<br />
making circles on the wind<br />
my own thoughts are looping, coldly<br />
leaving a slight taste of mint</p>

<p>standing back and holding noose<br />
remembering what once was<br />
praying my sins won’t come loose<br />
from my scars keeps leaking puss</p>

<p>love to keep creating more excuses<br />
to prolong inevitable<br />
but this body has limited uses<br />
and my mind stopped being able</p>

<p>this flesh prison of my own<br />
can be left behind to rot <br />
a knife’s thrust can make me mourn<br />
or a single thought, distraught</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="hobby">hobby</h3>

<p>all the knowledge, just for show<br />
you won’t do no thing with it<br />
lightbulb of yours, all but glow<br />
you will never really fit</p>

<p>but keep trying, you can’t tell<br />
if the learning is for you<br />
when your mind’s space becomes hell<br />
you will say “not seen that through”</p>

<p>teach and tell to those who listen<br />
their attention will feed thee<br />
maybe someday you will wisen<br />
and your lack of caring, see</p>

<p>all the knowledge, just for show<br />
you became aware of it<br />
now you hate the wisdom’s owl<br />
your conscience, eat by bit</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="isuckatnamingpoemsbutthisoneisaboutme-about-me-for-short">ISuckAtNamingPoemsButThisOneIsAboutMe (“about me” for short)</h3>

<p>now I know why I like mountains<br />
it’s so peaceful, lets me think<br />
gives me shade of my mind’s courtains<br />
lets emotions themselves bring</p>

<p>then, there’s learning, digging deep<br />
into cruel cogs of world<br />
something for my brain to feed<br />
gives me something to behold</p>

<p>understood why sailing brings me so much joy<br />
until now I saw it as a simple toy<br />
it gives me a feeling of complete control<br />
something that I lost, fell into black hole</p>

<p>lastly, writing, new addition, past-time hobby of my own<br />
little thing of my expression, and that lets me say mine word<br />
it feels good sometimes a lot, though it looks like I’m a clown<br />
when I do, makes me feel hot, my mind’s sturdy power cord</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="anxiety">anxiety</h3>

<p>terrified of what is<br />
genuinely scared of future<br />
those emotions don’t bring peace<br />
I don’t wish for them to nurture</p>

<p>I feel useless on my own<br />
and not needed among others<br />
holding onto a clown’s throne<br />
my own words are simply bothers</p>

<p>I don’t need your forced kindness<br />
I don’t want to be alone<br />
I just hope to be a mindless<br />
husk that will never be too known</p>

<p>yet, tomorrow, brand new day<br />
of suffering that I hate<br />
just survive untill it’s may<br />
after that, I will ask fate</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="misstake">misstake</h3>

<p>I feel putrid<br />
fake and broken<br />
my own thoughts keep strangling me<br />
long dead cupid<br />
I’ve awoken<br />
I have seen what you won’t see<br />
yet, keep talking<br />
heal my bones<br />
your kind words can bring me peace<br />
I’ll keep walking<br />
change my homes<br />
all I’ll hear from you, a hiss</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="still-breathing">still breathing</h3>

<p>my emotions no more matter<br />
they, orbiting satellites<br />
my ideas seem to gather<br />
among my heart’s acolytes</p>

<p>no more can I feel my face<br />
no more can I turn my back<br />
long ago I lost my taste<br />
all that’s left, a heart attack</p>

<p>I don’t want to see the day<br />
hope the shadows disappear<br />
none can see them anyway<br />
yet they still keep bringing fear</p>

<p>I don’t think I’m allowed to<br />
heal my festering wounds<br />
I gave all I could to you<br />
in return you freed the hounds</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="go-fluff-yourself">go fluff yourself</h3>

<p>I don’t say please, I don’t say thank you, I just do what I want<br />
and if you want to get with me you better have what I want<br />
so if you don’t care anymore I’ll make sure to break the bond<br />
‘cause from all that I have seen, you’re just a stupid fucking cunt</p>

<p>the anger that’s in me made both my eyes now turn red<br />
and all that you have ever done was to leave me on read<br />
my emotions from the anger slowly turn into dread<br />
how was I so fucking stupid to accept your own threat</p>

<p>from the bottom of the river to the top of the noose<br />
I just hope that your knot will never come and break loose<br />
and to hell your fucking body will be sent by Zeus<br />
once he notices your hand’s made wounds from which leaks my own puss</p>

<p>I have come to hate you, all you do is manipulate<br />
I’m so sick of always being so frustratingly late<br />
last to realize how you keep on loving to mutilate<br />
It’s too late to go back now, the changes are too great</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="solitude">solitude</h3>

<p>my mind’s worthless<br />
body’s rotting<br />
I don’t wish to exist now<br />
thoughts are homeless<br />
keep on cutting<br />
rust from knife makes my blood brown<br />
all are clueless<br />
question’s gutting<br />
they can’t see I’ve fallen down<br />
my room’s lifeless<br />
my bones crushing<br />
a death’s kiss like freedom’s crown</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="after">after</h3>

<p>bruises on my neck<br />
my body had been stained<br />
I feel like a wreck<br />
what have you even gained?</p>

<p>skinbag full of blood<br />
violet patches burn<br />
I don’t believe in god<br />
why else I’d have to mourn?</p>

<p>those questions in my head<br />
they dull the pain of flesh<br />
I’ll never leave my bed<br />
will my corpse stay still, fresh?</p>

<p>I never wanted this<br />
nostalgia kills my brain<br />
what do I even miss?<br />
my hurtfull thoughts will reign</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="something-beneath">Something beneath</h3>

<p>my own life just seems so boring<br />
yet I just can’t stop my worrying<br />
just existing feels so choring<br />
I can’t think without hurrying</p>

<p>empty words, can’t be specific<br />
what I hear though sounds terrific<br />
cold, yet still so scientific<br />
all the thoughts in me, horrific</p>

<p>slow descent into the madness<br />
slowly drowning in it’s vastness<br />
I can no more shield from dampness<br />
no acceptance adds to sadness</p>

<p>fear’s enough to keep on trying<br />
not enough to keep from crying<br />
no more can I keep from lying<br />
I still am so scared of dying</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="zorza">zorza</h3>

<p>horyzontu światła, zniczem mienią<br />
tuż nad głową czeluść czerni<br />
gigantyczny głaz jest “Ziemią”<br />
ludzie patrząc w dół, są bierni</p>

<p>czerwień, zieleń, tańczą wokół<br />
widowisko robiąc wielkie<br />
wszyscy boją się wyjść z domu<br />
diabły, widząc, w samym niebie</p>

<p>festiwalu, cisza nagła<br />
rozbrzmiewając pośród chmur<br />
wraz ze słońcem kiedyś biegła<br />
przyzywając kolej zmór</p>

<p>teraz, kamień, płaszczem płynnym<br />
okrywając ludzkie domy<br />
towarzyszy w tańcu zwinnym<br />
magnetyczne, świecąc gromy</p>

<h3 id="acceptance">acceptance</h3>

<p>I don’t deserve love<br />
I don’t deserve kinship<br />
if there’s a god above<br />
I hope he goes to shit</p>

<p>what for is my conscience<br />
if all I do is hurt<br />
salvation for my sins?<br />
my veins are full of dirt</p>

<p>promises that I’ve given<br />
promises that I broke<br />
I’ll never be forgiven<br />
on lies I’m gonna choke</p>

<p>all I have ever wanted<br />
slim hope of understanding<br />
my heart will still be haunted<br />
my head no more withstanding</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="imagination">imagination</h3>

<p>water, flowing, dripping slowly<br />
makes one wonder of the change<br />
crystal cave of creatures, lowly<br />
once a wall on mountain range</p>

<p>dare you enter, darkness awaits<br />
wet, unpleasant, earth-shattering<br />
suffocation, breathing space<br />
all around you, loud chittering</p>

<p>single lightsource, humble torch<br />
crystal clear reflections, jumping<br />
ancient promise, long lost church<br />
on the fairy visions, trampling</p>

<p>yet, the things you see, they’re living<br />
cackling, like the oldest witch<br />
fairies, goblins, dwarves are breathing<br />
don’t forget to wake up, snitch</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="end">End</h3>

<p>the world as we know it is ending<br />
leaving behind a frail track<br />
everyone else is just spending<br />
the time that is left till the crack</p>

<p>the colors, the shades and the pictures<br />
so burned into memories of youth<br />
all that’ll be left are the scriptures<br />
that thread ever further from truth</p>

<p>no one will see the tree fall<br />
no one will hear the loud thump<br />
last person on earth like a doll<br />
will meet their own end with a jump</p>

<p>this poem of mine that keeps going<br />
might never see the light of the sun<br />
the finish of humans, so boring<br />
last person, at least having fun</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="destruction">destruction</h3>

<p>passing time makes steel bleed red<br />
among rusting, broken structures<br />
holy earth was fed on lead<br />
lost memories left with fractures</p>

<p>I have seen the wicked men<br />
I have seen the holy land<br />
they have never seemed to learn<br />
never took the helping hand</p>

<p>now they rot with all their “glory”<br />
among things they deemed as “holy”<br />
pure radiation brought their end<br />
they have never called me “friend”</p>

<p>I don’t blame them though, not really<br />
they have always been so silly<br />
walking on the face of earth<br />
yet, forgetting their own breath</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="end-of-the-world">end of the world</h3>

<p>I’m so tired<br />
full of worry<br />
my own future won’t bring glory<br />
won’t be fired<br />
school is boring<br />
body’s skin is slowly rotting<br />
friends are going<br />
behind, leaving<br />
all the words turn into breathing<br />
my heart’s slowing<br />
abyss, warning<br />
my own eyes won’t see the morning</p>
